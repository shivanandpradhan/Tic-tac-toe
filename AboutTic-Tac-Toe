# Tic-tac-toe
A tic-tac-toe game project in c++ where two user can play many times they want to play.
And the most important part is that at each step, they will be aware about what is their current movement 
and they can also traverse back in the console to see their existing movement.
on each turn, a red background portion will show their current movement.

At the end, when one of the user Wins, then both user will also know how one wins and other loss. 
Actually the Background portion of blue will represent the pattern of winning.


What i like most after  making the logic and developing this piece of software and code?
I love the colors and the way each time it is showing the current user movement and i also like
the backgrounded-pattern (i.e printed in the end based on the winner) which represents how a person wins the game.
